#Hi Everyone

About this project:
    1. By measureing tank level using Ultrasonic sensor we can control the motor pump automatically.
    2. Also we can control the motor pump from remote location.
    3. Here, we are reading temperature & humidity and pushing values to the remote client.
	4. We are measureing soil moisture using soil moisture sensor. When the water/soil moist is below the
		specified level, it automatically opens the solenoid valve and supplies water.
	5. In addition to that we can control the valve(On/Off) from remote location.
